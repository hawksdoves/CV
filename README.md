# Phoebe Greig

My search for a career where I am not only excited about going to work but also, raring to learn and do more, led me to programming. Coding enables my creativity and engages with my analytical and quantitative nature.

My bubbly and lively personality, galvanises a team, creating a positive work environment. My aptitude at grasping new concepts rapidly, makes me an asset to any company.
